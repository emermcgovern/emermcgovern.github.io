      <h1>My Placement Experience</h1>
        <p>As part of my degree there is an option for third year students to either study aboard
         or go on work placement. Due to the current travel restrcitons because of COVID 19 travelling abroad
         was not an option for my class. To accomodate to the students during this difficult time
         we were given the three options. Either go on full time placement, part time placment or
         decide against going on placement entirely and instead pick three modules. </p>
      
         <br>
        <h2>Choosing my placement option</h2>
          <p>I chose to go on part time placement. Which is a total of 150 hours over the course of 12 weeks.
           This roughly works out to being around one work day a week. I chose this options as I realised due
           to the majority of workplaces being closed that I would be doing the placement remotely.</p>
             
           <p>I'm currently on placment remotely with a Galway based company called Martec.
            I help with editing online websites for companies all across Ireland, ranging from mechanical 
            engineering factories to clothing retail shops. Even though it isn't the placement experience
            I anticipated I'm really enjoying the placment thus far.</p>
      <br> 
        <h2>My overall experience</h2>
          <p>As mentioned earlier this placement is a very different experience due to the current restrictions.
           However, I believe remote placement does have its benefits. The best part about my placement
           being done remotely is that I can chose what times I work at. I usually get sent an email at
           the start of the week with whatever tasks I'm expected to do by the end of the week. From there 
           I have complete freedom on how I work on the tasks. I usually break the work up over 2 or 3 days. 
           The remote placement expierence has also allowed me to become
           much more independent and self motivated.</p>
